## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **NPM**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Node.js dependencies: ```npm install``` (Use your preferred package manager)
3. Run the development server: ```npm run dev```
4. The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Usage
After installing all dependencies and running the development server you can start customizing your portfolio:

- Update Your Information
  - Edit the data arrays such as your experiences, projects, and social links directly in the corresponding component files (e.g., Experience.tsx, Projects.tsx, SocialMedia.tsx).

- Change Profile Picture and Bio
  - Replace the default image and modify your personal description in the Home.tsx section.

- Customize the Tech Stack
  - Add or remove technologies with their names and icons in the AboutMe.tsx file. Iconify is used for consistent and scalable icons.

- Adjust Colors and Styles
  - Tweak the design using Tailwind CSS classes, or enhance the UI with more shadcn/ui components.

- Deploy Your Portfolio
  - Once you're happy with the design, deploy it to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
